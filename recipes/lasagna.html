<p>this is a delicious lasagna</p>

<h3>Ingridients</h3>

<ul>
<li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
<li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
<li>1 carrot, chopped</li>
<li>1 shallot, minced</li>
<li>3 ounces prosciutto, chopped</li>
<li>11 ounces ground pork</li>
<li>11 ounces ground beef</li>
<li>1 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
<li>Â½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
<li>salt to taste</li>
<li>6 fluid ounces red wine</li>
<li>21 ounces peeled San Marzano tomatoes</li>
</ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
<li>Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onion, carrot, shallot, and prosciutto until onion is translucent and prosciutto releases some fat, about 10 minutes. Add pork and beef; season with 1 teaspoon nutmeg, cinnamon, and salt to taste. Cook and stir over medium-high heat until browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Pour red wine over meat mixture; increase heat and cook until wine evaporates, about 3 minutes. Add tomatoes and mix well; bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes break down and flavors of Bolognese sauce have combined, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.</li>
<li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat; add flour. Whisk vigorously until mixture is smooth. Pour in milk and cook, stirring occasionally, over medium heat until white sauce thickens enough to cover the back of a spoon, about 10 minutes; season with 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, salt, and pepper.</li>

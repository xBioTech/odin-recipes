<p>Those a the BEST Chocolate Cookies on Earth !</p>

<h3>Ingridients</h3>

<ul>
<li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
<li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
<li>1 large egg</li>
<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
<li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
<li>¼ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
<li>¾ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
<li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
<li>sanding sugar</li>
</ul>
<p>Filling</p>
<ul>
    <li>¼ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
    <li>2 ounces semi-sweet chocolate, chopped</li>
</ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of oven. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
<li>Beat butter and sugar at medium speed with an electric mixer until fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add egg and vanilla, beating until incorporated.</li>
<li>Whisk together flour, cocoa, salt, and cinnamon in a medium bowl until combined. With mixer on low speed, gradually add flour mixture to butter mixture, beating until well combined, about 2 minutes.</li>
<li>Roll dough into 1 1/4-inch balls, then roll balls in sanding sugar. Place on the prepared baking sheets, spacing 2 inches apart. Press the center of each ball with your thumb (about 1/2-inch deep and 1/2-inch wide).</li>
<li>Bake in preheated oven in upper and lower thirds, 2 baking sheets at a time, rotating top to bottom and bottom to top halfway through, until cookies are set and almost firm, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Let cool on baking sheets, about 15 minutes. When cool, press the center of each ball with your thumb again—the indentations will have puffed in the oven.</li>
<li>Heat cream in a small microwavable bowl on HIGH until just steaming, about 45 seconds. Remove from the heat, and add chopped chocolate. Let the mixture sit, undisturbed, for 2 minutes. Stir until melted and smooth. Let cool until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Place about 1 teaspoon filling in the center of each cookie. Slide the cookies into the refrigerator for about 10 minutes to set the filling. The cookies will keep for about 5 days in an airtight container at room temperature.</li>
